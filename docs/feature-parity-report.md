## Implementation Priorities

### High Priority (Must Have)
1. FCX Mode
2. Complete FormID database
3. Move unsolved logs
4. Mod manager integration
5. Auto-update checking

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
1. Simplify logs
2. Statistical logging
3. VR mode support
4. Audio notifications
5. Recent items management

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Backup/restore functionality
2. Custom themes
3. Advanced statistics
4. Export features

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Database Compatibility**: Ensure YAML databases are 100% compatible with Python version
2. **Output Format**: Use integration tests to verify output matches Python exactly
3. **Performance**: Implement caching and async operations to match Python performance
4. **Migration Path**: Provide tools to migrate settings from existing CLASSIC installations

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All crash logs analyzed by Scanner111 produce identical output to CLASSIC-Fallout4
- [ ] FCX mode detects all game integrity issues found by Python version
- [ ] Performance is within 10% of Python implementation
- [ ] All existing CLASSIC users can migrate without data loss
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 90% for core functionality

## Estimated Timeline

**Total Duration**: 12-16 weeks for full feature parity

- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2: 3-4 weeks  
- Phase 3: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 4: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 5: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 6: 2 weeks

**Parallel Work**: Phases 3 and 4 can partially overlap, potentially reducing total time by 1-2 weeks.

## Conclusion

Achieving feature parity with CLASSIC-Fallout4 requires significant development effort, particularly in areas of database integration, file management, and mod manager support. The phased approach allows for incremental delivery of value while maintaining compatibility with the existing Python implementation.
