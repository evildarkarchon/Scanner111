### Mod Compatibility Guidance
- Legacy version benefits clearly communicated
- Warnings about outdated versions balanced with mod compatibility info
- No pressure to update if using legacy versions intentionally

## Implementation Notes

### Hash Collection Required
The placeholder hashes in the code need to be replaced with actual SHA256 hashes:
- Collect from trusted community sources
- Verify across multiple installations
- Document hash sources for transparency

### Future Extensibility
The system is designed to easily add:
- New game versions as they release
- Additional games if needed later
- Version-specific mod compatibility databases

### Best Practices
- Always detect version before making recommendations
- Respect user choice to stay on older versions
- Provide clear information without forcing updates
- Link to appropriate mod resources for each version
