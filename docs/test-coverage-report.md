## Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (High Impact, Low Effort) ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Add CLI Command Tests**: ✅ All commands now have comprehensive tests
2. **Test Converters**: ✅ All 3 UI converters have 100% coverage
3. **Increase Analyzer Coverage**: ✅ Edge case tests added for all low-coverage analyzers
4. **ViewModel Testing**: ✅ All ViewModels now have 100% coverage

### Medium Priority (High Impact, Medium Effort)
1. **FileScanService**: Increase coverage from 30% to 80%+
2. **Service Layer Tests**: Test GUI services independently
3. **Fix Failing Tests**: Address 16 failing tests in CLI and integration areas

### Long-term Goals
1. **UI Automation Tests**: Consider Avalonia.Headless for UI testing
2. **End-to-End Tests**: Full workflow tests from crash log to report
3. **Performance Tests**: Ensure pipeline performance at scale

## Test Quality Observations

### Positive Patterns
- Extensive use of xUnit with proper async test patterns
- Good test organization mirroring source structure
- Comprehensive test helpers and mock implementations
- Settings tests using collection fixtures for isolation
- Shared test infrastructure (TestMessageCapture) reduces duplication
- Thorough edge case testing for critical components
- Proper use of Theory tests for parametric testing

### Areas for Improvement
- Some tests have compiler warnings (CS8625, xUnit1012)
- Limited integration test coverage
- No performance or stress tests
- ViewModels remain untested

## Coverage Trends
This is the first comprehensive coverage report. Future reports should track:
- Coverage trend over time
- New code coverage requirements
- Test execution time trends
- Flaky test identification

## Action Items
1. Set minimum coverage requirements for new code (suggest 80%)
2. Add coverage gates to CI/CD pipeline
3. Focus on testing critical user paths
4. Implement missing unit tests for high-value components
5. Consider test-driven development for new features
