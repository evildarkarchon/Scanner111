3. **Stress Testing**: Add tests for high-load scenarios

### Long-term Goals
1. **UI Automation Tests**: Consider Avalonia.Headless for full UI testing
2. **Mutation Testing**: Use tools like Stryker.NET to validate test quality
3. **Coverage Gates**: Enforce minimum coverage for new code (80% recommended)

## Test Quality Observations

### Positive Patterns
- Extensive use of xUnit with proper async test patterns
- Comprehensive test organization mirroring source structure (82 test files)
- Rich test infrastructure with mock implementations
- Good use of [Theory] tests for parametric testing
- Proper test isolation using collection fixtures
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
