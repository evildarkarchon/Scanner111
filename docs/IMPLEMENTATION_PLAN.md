## Notes

- Phases can be developed in parallel by different team members
- Priority should be given to Phase 1 and 2 as they provide the most value
- Each feature should be developed following TDD principles
- All async code must use ConfigureAwait(false) in library code
- Thread-safety must be documented and tested for all shared state
- Performance benchmarks should be established before optimization
